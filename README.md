## Lab-4.1: Word embedding

#### 1. Train Word2Vect model
use Gensim to train a low dimensional word-2-vect model (with either 2 or 3 dimensional embedding space) with provided text.

#### 2. Clustering
Do K-means clustering on vectors in the embedding space to search for groupings of data
(run elbow method to try to find the optimal number of clusters)

#### 3. Visualize the results
A plot showing the embedding space points where the color-coding is based on the K-means results

#### 4. Pre-Trained model
Construct an embedding space using either (1) a pre-trained Glove model OR (2) a pre-trained word-2-vec model

#### 5. Visualize the results
Generate one plot to visualize this higher dimensional embedding space (be creative)
