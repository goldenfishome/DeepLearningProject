# Deep Learning Projects

## Lab-4.1: Word embedding

### Lab-4.1.1: Train Word2Vect model
use Gensim to train a low dimensional word-2-vect model (with either 2 or 3 dimensional embedding space) with provided text.

### Lab-4.1.2: Clustering
Do K-means clustering on vectors in the embedding space to search for groupings of data
(run elbow method to try to find the optimal number of clusters)

### Lab-4.1.3: Visualize the results
A plot showing the embedding space points where the color-coding is based on the K-means results

### Lab-4.1.4: Pre-Trained model
Construct an embedding space using either (1) a pre-trained Glove model OR (2) a pre-trained word-2-vec model

### Lab-4.1.5: Visualize the results
Generate one plot to visualize this higher dimensional embedding space (be creative)
